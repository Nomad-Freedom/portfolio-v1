My portfolio was built to showcase projects and information that you
might want to know about me. It includes a download link to my
resume, featured projects, as well as a contact link connected to my
email. This website was built with React, TypeScript, Next.js, Emotion JS
for handling the CSS, and serverless functions to handle form validation.
